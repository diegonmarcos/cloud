# AI Multi-Model Orchestration Plan v5
## "The Uncomfortable Truth" - What Actually Works

## Why v1-v4 Are All Wrong

### The Fine-Tuning Fantasy

```
YOUR BELIEF:
"I'll fine-tune a model on my data and it will become ME"

REALITY:
Fine-tuned 32B ≠ Opus
Fine-tuned 32B = Slightly better 32B (still dumb compared to Opus)

The base model's ceiling is the ceiling.
You can't train genius into a mediocre student.
```

### The CEO Delusion

| What You Imagine | What Actually Happens |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Year 5: Model thinks like me | Year 5: Model overfits to your old patterns |
| Year 5: Handles 90% alone | Year 5: New Opus 6 is 10x better anyway |
| Year 5: My digital twin | Year 5: A weird echo of 2025-you |

**Models improve faster than your fine-tuning.**
By 2027, a base model will beat your 2-year-trained "CEO".

### The Complexity Trap

Your plans have:
- 4 layers of routing
- 6 models to manage
- Training pipelines
- Quality scoring
- Monthly fine-tuning
- Knowledge graphs
- Vector DBs
- Memory systems

**This is a full-time job, not a productivity tool.**

You'll spend more time maintaining the AI system than doing actual work.

### The Real Bottleneck

```
It's not the model. It's YOU.

## What Actually Matters

### The 80/20 Reality

```
80% of your AI value comes from:
├─ Good prompts
├─ Good context (paste the right files)
├─ Clear requirements
└─ Quick feedback loops

20% comes from:
└─ Model choice (Opus vs Sonnet vs whatever)

0% comes from:
├─ Fine-tuning
├─ Complex orchestration
├─ Multi-model routing
└─ Training pipelines
```

### RAG >> Fine-tuning

| Approach | For "knowing your repos" |
|----------|-------------------------|
| Fine-tuning | Bakes old knowledge into weights, expensive, slow, outdated instantly |
| **RAG** | Fresh retrieval every time, cheap, updates automatically, actually accurate |

**You don't need to train a model to know your code.**
**You need to paste your code into the context.**

### The Model Upgrade Treadmill

```
2025: Train on DeepSeek 32B (6 months work)
2026: Llama 4 releases, 10x better base
2026: Your trained model is now obsolete
2026: Start over? Or use the better base?

Fine-tuning = Swimming against the current
```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### What To Actually Build

**NOT an AI training pipeline.**
**Build these instead:**

#### 1. Context Injection System (2 days work)

```
/context/
├── patterns.md        # Your coding patterns
├── architecture.md    # Your system design principles
├── style.md           # Your preferences
├── runbooks/          # Common operations
└── project-contexts/  # Per-project context files
```

Every prompt automatically includes relevant context.
**This gives you 90% of "personal AI" benefits with 1% of the work.**

#### 2. Project Templates (1 day work)

```
# Instead of training AI to know your patterns:
# Just have templates that ARE your patterns

/templates/
├── new-service/       # Your service boilerplate
├── new-api/           # Your API patterns
├── new-infra/         # Your Terraform patterns
└── new-script/        # Your script patterns
```

**AI + Template > Trained AI**

#### 3. Good Documentation (Ongoing)

```
The best "memory" is written documentation.

/docs/
├── decisions/         # Why you chose X over Y
├── incidents/         # Past problems and solutions
├── patterns/          # Reusable approaches
└── anti-patterns/     # Things that failed
```

**This is searchable, version-controlled, and works without AI.**

### When To Upgrade To Opus

| Just Use Sonnet | Consider Opus |
|-----------------|---------------|
| 95% of tasks | Genuinely stuck |
| Code writing | Novel architecture |
| Bug fixing | Security audit |
| Refactoring | Critical decisions |
| Docs | Creative solutions |

**Simple rule: Start with Sonnet. Upgrade to Opus when Sonnet fails.**

No routing. No scoring. No complexity.
Just: "Sonnet didn't work, let me try Opus."

## What About Local/Open Source?

### The Honest Math

| Scenario | Monthly Cost |
|----------|--------------|
| Sonnet API (heavy use) | $50-100 |
| Local GPU VPS | $45-90 |
| Your time maintaining local | 5+ hours |

**If your time is worth >$10/hr, the API is cheaper.**

### When Local Actually Makes Sense

```
✓ Privacy-critical (medical, legal, etc.)
✓ Offline requirement
✓ Very high volume (1M+ tokens/day)
✓ You enjoy the hobby

✗ "To save money" - Usually doesn't
✗ "To train my own" - Waste of time
✗ "For better quality" - APIs are better
```

## The 10-Year Play (Actually Smart Version)

### What Compounds

| Investment | 10-Year Value |
|------------|---------------|
| ~~Training your model~~ | Obsolete in 2 years |
| **Your documentation** | Still useful in 20 years |
| **Your templates** | Evolve with you |
| **Your tooling** | Transfers to any AI |
| **Your patterns** | The real knowledge |

### The Real Asset

```
It's not a trained model.
It's not a knowledge graph.
It's not a vector DB.

It's YOUR ORGANIZED KNOWLEDGE in plain text.

- README files
- Architecture docs
- Decision records
- Runbooks
- Templates
- Scripts

This works with ANY AI, forever.
No vendor lock-in. No training needed.
Just paste it into the context.
```

## Revised Cost

### v4 (Your Plan)

| Component | Monthly | Annual |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Multi-model APIs | $100-200 | $1,200-2,400 |
| GPU VPS | $45-90 | $540-1,080 |
| Your time (10h/mo) | $500+ | $6,000+ |
| **Total** | | **$7,740-9,480** |

### v5 (Simple Plan)

| Component | Monthly | Annual |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Sonnet API | $50-80 | $600-960 |
| Context files | 0 | 0 |
| Your time (1h/mo) | $50 | $600 |
| **Total** | | **$1,200-1,560** |

**Savings: $6,500-8,000/year**
**Time saved: 108 hours/year**

## If You MUST Build Something

The only thing worth building:

```python
# context-injector.py (50 lines)

def get_context(task_type: str) -> str:
    """Load relevant context for this task type."""
    contexts = {
        "infra": ["patterns/infra.md", "runbooks/deploy.md"],
        "api": ["patterns/api.md", "templates/endpoint.py"],
        "debug": ["incidents/", "patterns/debugging.md"],
    }
    return load_files(contexts.get(task_type, ["patterns/general.md"]))

def prompt(task: str) -> str:
    context = get_context(classify(task))
    return f"""
    Context about my patterns:
    {context}

    Task: {task}
    """

# That's it. That's the whole system.
# Everything else is over-engineering.
```

## Summary

| Plan | Philosophy | Verdict |
|------|------------|---------|
| v1 | Right model for right task | Over-engineered |
| v2 | Local-first, escalate | Still complex |
| v3 | Knowledge layer | Good idea, bad execution |
| v4 | Train your CEO | Fantasy |
| **v5** | **Just use Sonnet + good context** | **Actually works** |

**The best AI system is the one you don't have to maintain.**
